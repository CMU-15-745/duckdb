TODO:
- Pass only current_correlated_columns to flatten in plan_subquery.cpp:430
- Fix rewriter to call VisitReplace only on the current_correlated_columns
- Fix current_correlated_columns so that it doesn't take depth=0 and 1 for laterals and subqueries respectivelySELECT * FROM (SELECT 42) t(i)
- Push correlated columns into a set to remove duplicate references?

- Disable perform_delim maybe (once everything is working)?
